                              * Increased Accidents
                                   The more vehicles that there are on a roadway, the more accidents there are going to
				   be. In fact, in many urban areas, traffic-related auto accidents are a leading cause
				   of death. Of course, mortality is the primary concern of traffic-related accidents; 
				   however, collisions in which drivers and passengers do not sustain injuries are problematic, 
				   as well. Even minor fender benders can cause thousands of dollars in damages.

                              * Air Pollution
                                   Accidents aren't the only problem associated with traffic congestion as pollution
                                   is a significant concern, too. More cars, buses, trucks, SUVs, motorcycles, and other
                                   vehicles create harmful emissions that can hurt the environment. As more VOCs are emitted 
				   into the atmosphere, the quality of the air is impacted. Traffic-related pollution 
				   contributes to an influx of health problems. In some urban areas, the pollution levels are 
				   so high that you can quite literally see a blanket of smog enveloping the city.

                              * Reduced Emergency Assistance
                                   When roadways are congested, emergency vehicles are unable to make their way through.
                                   In the event of an emergency, motorists struggle to pull over to allow ambulances,
                                   patrol cars, and other vital response vehicles to pass through, further worsening the gridlock.
				   And of course, emergency care is delayed, which could ultimately put lives in danger.

			      * Reduced Productivity
			  	   A high volume of vehicles on urban roadways significantly reduces the richness of the city. 
				   Employees are late to work, deliveries are delayed, and appointments are canceled. Businesses 
				   in high-traffic cities can suffer significant consequences.

                    * Interventions to reduce traffic congestion

                              1. Optimise traffic-light management
                              2. Use CCTV to monitor road conditions
                              3. Charge for workplace parking
                              4. Improve perceptions of buses
                              5. Use Inbound Flow Control
                              6. Improve cycling infrastructure


                    * The one-hit solution

                              1. Widen roads / Narrow roads
                              2. Add bus lanes / Remove bus lanes
                              3. Build tunnels
                              4. Build a light rail network
                              5. Ban cycling / Ban cars from city centres
                              6. Introduce a congestion charge/road pricing
                              7. Build more car parks
